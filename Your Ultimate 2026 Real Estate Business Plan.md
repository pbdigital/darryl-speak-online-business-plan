**Why It Matters:** Awareness of your strengths and areas of improvement empowers you to take focused, effective action. It helps you play to your strengths while proactively addressing challenges.

**How to Fill It Out:** Use the prompts to brainstorm your current strengths, weaknesses, external opportunities, and possible threats. For each, include action steps:

- **Strengths:** Where can you leverage what you do well?
- **Weaknesses:** What do you need to accept, delegate, or improve?
- **Opportunities:** What chances for growth or change exist?
- **Threats:** What internal or external factors could hold you back?

# SECTION 3: Vision, Goals, and Income Planning

**What It Is:** This section helps you set clear, measurable goals for your income and business growth, and ties them to your larger vision.

**Why It Matters:** Goals give you direction, structure, and benchmarks to measure success. Knowing your numbers allows you to manage your time and energy wisely. When you understand the complete financial picture—from expenses to income to daily activities—you create a roadmap that turns dreams into actionable steps.

**How to Fill It Out:** Work through each step sequentially. The math builds on itself, so don't skip ahead. Use a calculator and be honest with your numbers.

---

## PART 3A: Understanding Your Financial Foundation

Before we can set income goals, we need to understand your true cost of living. This exercise provides clarity about your annual financial bottom line.

### Step 1: Calculate Your Monthly Personal Expenses

List all your monthly personal expenses. Be thorough and honest—this is the foundation of your plan.

| Personal Expense | Monthly Amount | Field Type |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| Mortgage/Rent | $_________ | `currency` |
| Car Payment | $_________ | `currency` |
| Car Gas | $_________ | `currency` |
| Car Maintenance | $_________ | `currency` |
| Car Insurance | $_________ | `currency` |
| Electric | $_________ | `currency` |
| Gas/Heat | $_________ | `currency` |
| Cable | $_________ | `currency` |
| Internet | $_________ | `currency` |
| Cell Phone | $_________ | `currency` |
| Water/Sewer | $_________ | `currency` |
| Food/Groceries | $_________ | `currency` |
| Dining Out/Entertainment | $_________ | `currency` |
| Travel | $_________ | `currency` |
| Child Care | $_________ | `currency` |
| Savings/Investments | $_________ | `currency` |
| Health Insurance | $_________ | `currency` |
| Credit Card Payments | $_________ | `currency` |
| Student Loans | $_________ | `currency` |
| Other: _________ (`text`) | $_________ | `currency` |
| **MONTHLY PERSONAL TOTAL:** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |

---

### Step 2: Calculate Your Monthly Business Expenses

**Pro Tip:** For any bills you pay annually (like board dues or insurance), divide the cost by 12 to get the monthly amount. For example: $1,200 annual board dues ÷ 12 = $100 per month.

| Business Expense | Monthly Amount | Field Type |
|-----------------|----------------|------------|
| Board Dues (annual ÷ 12) | $_________ | `currency` |
| MLS Fees (annual ÷ 12) | $_________ | `currency` |
| Desk Fees | $_________ | `currency` |
| E&O Insurance (annual ÷ 12) | $_________ | `currency` |
| Education/Training | $_________ | `currency` |
| Advertising/Lead Generation | $_________ | `currency` |
| Print Marketing | $_________ | `currency` |
| Signs/For Sale Signs | $_________ | `currency` |
| Business Cards | $_________ | `currency` |
| Events/Networking | $_________ | `currency` |
| Photography | $_________ | `currency` |
| CRM/Software | $_________ | `currency` |
| Other: _________ (`text`) | $_________ | `currency` |
| Other: _________ (`text`) | $_________ | `currency` |
| **MONTHLY BUSINESS TOTAL:** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |

---

### Step 3: Calculate Your Total Annual Expenses

Now add up your monthly totals and multiply by 12 to get your annual expenses.

| Item | Amount | Field Type |
|------|--------|------------|
| Total Monthly Personal Expenses | $_________ | `currency` |
| Total Monthly Business Expenses | $_________ | `currency` |
| **COMBINED MONTHLY TOTAL** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |
| **ANNUAL EXPENSES (multiply above by 12)** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |

*This is your baseline—the minimum you need to earn just to maintain your current lifestyle and cover business costs.*

---

## PART 3B: Your Manifest List — What Else Do You Desire?

Beyond covering your expenses, what do you want to accomplish in 2026? Be specific and honest. If you dream of travel, paying off debt, buying investment properties, or upgrading your lifestyle—write it down and cost it out. This is your WHY.

> **Reminder:** Make sure to save your work.

### Family Goals

What do you want to do with or for your family? Examples: Family vacation ($5,000), Weekly date nights ($5,200), New home down payment ($50,000)

| # | Goal Name | Money Needed | Field Types |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 2 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 3 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 4 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 5 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |

### Financial Goals

What financial milestones do you want to hit? Examples: Pay off $8,000 credit card debt, Build $12,000 emergency fund, Invest $1,000/month ($12,000)

| # | Goal Name | Money Needed | Field Types |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 2 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 3 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 4 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 5 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |

### Personal Goals

What do you want for yourself? Examples: Personal trainer ($6,000), New wardrobe ($3,000), Masters degree program ($15,000)

| # | Goal Name | Money Needed | Field Types |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 2 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 3 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 4 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 5 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |

### Business Goals

What investments in your business do you want to make? Examples: Hire part-time assistant ($24,000), Upgrade website ($3,000), Better CRM ($2,400)

| # | Goal Name | Money Needed | Field Types |
|---|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 2 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 3 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 4 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |
| 5 | _________________ | $_________ | `text`, `currency` |

| **TOTAL COST OF MANIFEST LIST:** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |
|----------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|

*These are your dreams and goals—the life you want to build. Now let's calculate what it takes to make them real.*

---

## PART 3C: Calculating Your Target Take-Home Income

Now we'll calculate how much money you need to take home (after taxes) to cover both your baseline expenses and your manifest list goals.

It's simple math: Add your annual expenses + your manifest goals = your target take-home income.

| Item | Amount | Field Type |
|------|--------|------------|
| Total Annual Expenses (from Part 3A) | $_________ | `currency` |
| Total Manifest Goals (from Part 3B) | $_________ | `currency` |
| **TARGET ANNUAL TAKE-HOME INCOME** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |

*This is the amount you want to KEEP after paying taxes. But we need to account for taxes to know how much you actually need to EARN.*

---

## PART 3D: Accounting for Taxes — Your Taxable Income

Your tax rate depends on your income level and state. Consult your tax professional to estimate your combined federal and state tax rate. Common rates range from 25-40%. For this exercise, we'll use a conservative estimate.

### Here's How It Works (Example):

Let's say your target take-home income is $150,000 and your tax rate is 35%:

- **Step 1:** Take your tax rate and divide by 100: 35 ÷ 100 = 0.35
- **Step 2:** Subtract that from 1.0: 1.0 - 0.35 = 0.65
- **Step 3:** Divide your target take-home income by that result: $150,000 ÷ 0.65 = $230,769

That means you need to earn $230,769 before taxes to take home $150,000.

### Now You Try:

| Item | Value | Field Type |
|------|-------|------------|
| My Estimated Tax Rate (ask your tax professional) | _____% | `percentage` |
| Step 1: Tax Rate ÷ 100 | 0._____ | `decimal` (calculated) |
| Step 2: Subtract from 1.0 (1.0 minus result above) | 0._____ | `decimal` (calculated) |
| My Target Take-Home Income (from Part 3C) | $_________ | `currency` |
| Step 3: Divide take-home by Step 2 result | $_________ | `currency` (calculated) |
| **ANNUAL TAXABLE INCOME NEEDED** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |

*This is the amount you must earn BEFORE taxes to achieve your financial goals.*

---

## PART 3E: Calculating Your Gross Commission Income (GCI) Goal

Your Annual Taxable Income is what's left AFTER your broker takes their split and your business expenses are deducted from your Gross Commission Income (GCI). Now we'll reverse engineer your GCI goal based on your broker's commission structure.

### Step 1: Account for Your Broker's Commission Split

What percentage does your broker take? For example, if they take 20%, you keep 80%.

**Example Calculation:**
If your taxable income needed is $230,769 and your broker takes 20%:

- **Step 1:** 20 ÷ 100 = 0.20
- **Step 2:** 1.0 - 0.20 = 0.80 (you keep 80%)
- **Step 3:** $230,769 ÷ 0.80 = $288,461 GCI needed

### Now You Try:

| Item | Value | Field Type |
|------|-------|------------|
| My Broker's Commission Split Percentage | _____% | `percentage` |
| Step 1: Broker's Split ÷ 100 | 0._____ | `decimal` (calculated) |
| Step 2: Your Share (1.0 minus result above) | 0._____ | `decimal` (calculated) |
| My Annual Taxable Income Needed (from Part 3D) | $_________ | `currency` |
| Step 3: Divide taxable income by your share | $_________ | `currency` (calculated) |
| **GCI NEEDED (before broker split)** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |

### Step 2: Does Your Broker Offer a Cap? (Optional)

Some brokers offer 100% commission after you reach a certain cap (for example, after you've paid $16,000 in splits, everything after that is 100% yours). If this applies to you, complete this section. If not, skip to Part 3F.

| Item | Value | Field Type |
|------|-------|------------|
| My Broker's Capped Commission Amount | $_________ | `currency` |
| My Taxable Income Needed | $_________ | `currency` |
| **ADJUSTED GCI NEEDED (add them together)** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |

*If your broker doesn't offer a cap, use your GCI from Step 1. If they do offer a cap, use your Adjusted GCI from Step 2.*

---

## PART 3F: How Many Transactions Do You Need?

Now let's figure out how many transactions you'll need to close to reach your GCI goal. This is where your income goal becomes a countable target.

### Step 1: Determine Your Average Commission Per Transaction

Look at your market stats. What's the average sales price? What's the typical commission rate you earn? For example: $350,000 average sales price × 2.5% commission rate = $8,750 per transaction.

| Item | Value | Field Type |
|------|-------|------------|
| Average Sales Price in My Market | $_________ | `currency` |
| My Average Commission Rate (e.g., 2.5% = 0.025) | 0._____ | `decimal` |
| Multiply them (Sales Price × Commission Rate) | $_________ | `currency` (calculated) |
| **AVERAGE COMMISSION PER TRANSACTION** | **$_________** | `currency` (calculated) |

### Step 2: Calculate Total Transactions Needed

Now divide your GCI goal by your average commission per transaction. For example: $288,461 GCI ÷ $8,750 per transaction = 33 transactions needed.

| Item | Value | Field Type |
|------|-------|------------|
| My GCI Goal (from Part 3E) | $_________ | `currency` |
| My Average Commission Per Transaction (from above) | $_________ | `currency` |
| Divide GCI by Average Commission | _________ | `number` (calculated) |
| **TOTAL TRANSACTIONS NEEDED IN 2026** | **_________** | `number` (calculated) |

*This is your annual transaction target. Now let's figure out what daily activities will get you there.*

---

## PART 3G: Reverse Engineering Your Daily Activities

This is where the magic happens. We're going to reverse engineer your annual transaction goal into specific daily activities. This way, you'll know EXACTLY what to do each day to hit your income goals.

Industry research shows these average conversion ratios work for most real estate agents:

- **5 appointments = 1 closed transaction** (One out of every 5 appointments you set results in a closed deal)
- **16 conversations = 1 appointment** (You need 16 meaningful conversations to set 1 appointment)
- **12.5 reach-outs = 1 conversation** (You need to reach out to 12.5 people to have 1 meaningful conversation)

### Step 1: Calculate Your Annual Activity Goals

Using the conversion ratios above, let's calculate your annual needs:

| Activity | Calculation | Your Number | Field Type |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Closed Transactions | From Part 3F | _________ | `number` |
| Appointments Needed | Transactions × 5 | _________ | `number` (calculated) |
| Conversations Needed | Appointments × 16 | _________ | `number` (calculated) |
| Reach-Outs Needed | Conversations × 12.5 | _________ | `number` (calculated) |

### Step 2: Calculate Your Daily Activity Goals

Now let's break these annual numbers down to daily targets. First, how many days will you actually work in 2026?

Example: If you work 5 days per week for 52 weeks, that's 260 working days. If you take 4 weeks vacation, that's 240 working days.

| Item | Value | Field Type |
|------|-------|------------|
| How many days per week will you work? | _____ days | `number` |
| How many weeks will you take off? | _____ weeks | `number` |
| Calculate: (Days per week × 52) - (Days per week × Weeks off) | _____ working days | `number` (calculated) |

| Daily Target | Value | Field Type |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| **REACH-OUTS PER DAY** (Annual reach-outs ÷ Working days) | _________ | `number` (calculated) |
| **CONVERSATIONS PER DAY** (Annual conversations ÷ Working days) | _________ | `number` (calculated) |
| **APPOINTMENTS PER DAY** (Annual appointments ÷ Working days) | _________ | `number` (calculated) |

*These are your daily targets. Post them where you'll see them every single day.*

---

## PART 3H: Your Income Commitment

You've done the work. You know your numbers. Now it's time to commit. This commitment statement is your anchor—refer back to it daily, weekly, and monthly.

### Fill in your commitment:

| Item | Value | Field Type |
|------|-------|------------|
| **MY ANNUAL GCI GOAL IS:** | $_________ | `currency` |
| **TO REACH THIS GOAL, I NEED TO CLOSE:** | _________ TRANSACTIONS | `number` |

**WHICH MEANS EVERY DAY I NEED TO:**

| Activity | Target | Field Type |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Make | _________ reach-outs | `number` |
| Have | _________ conversations | `number` |
| Set | _________ appointments | `number` |

### REACHING THIS GOAL MEANS:

*Write what achieving this goal means for you and your family. Be specific. What will you be able to do? How will you feel? What will change?*

# SECTION 4: Mindset, Self-Care, and Motivation

**What It Is:** Your mindset is the engine of your business. This section helps you strengthen the thoughts, habits, and routines that keep you grounded, focused, and fueled—especially when the market, clients, or life gets noisy.

**Why It Matters:** Real estate is a high-energy, high-emotion profession. Without strong internal systems—mindset, boundaries, and self-care—you risk burnout, inconsistency, and decision fatigue. A healthy mindset creates emotional endurance. Self-care restores your energy. Motivation keeps you moving when results feel slow. Together, they make you resilient, productive, and steady.

## The Project Matrix: Managing Multiple Business Projects

### Project Matrix Overview:

Beyond daily lead generation and client care, there are key projects that can transform your business long-term, like setting up a CRM, hiring an assistant, or farming a neighborhood. These are projects that require multiple steps to complete. The Project Matrix helps you keep them organized and actionable.

### How to Use It:

1. **List Your Projects:** Across the top of your matrix (as column headers), write down 3-5 major business projects you want to complete this year. Examples include:
   - Hire an Assistant
   - Implement a CRM
   - Launch a Farming Campaign
   - Secure One Contract per Month
   - List 24 Properties

2. **Break Down the Tasks:** Under each project column, list the individual tasks required to complete that project. These should be specific, manageable steps like "Write job description," "Input past clients into CRM," or "Determine farm area."

3. **Prioritize:** Once the tasks are listed, sort them vertically from top to bottom in the order they should be completed. This way, you always know what the next task is.

4. **Daily Focus:** Each day, look at your matrix and work on completing just the first row across all active projects. For example, complete the top task under "Hire an Assistant," then the top task under "Have a CRM," and so on.

5. **Highlight Progress:** Once a task is completed, highlight that box in yellow. This gives you a clear visual cue that you're moving forward. Then proceed to the second row of tasks across each project, repeating the process.

**Why This Works:** It keeps you from bouncing between tasks or feeling overwhelmed. You'll make progress in every area of your business without burning out. It also allows you to integrate long-term growth strategies into your daily workflow without neglecting your transactional work.

**Include in Your Toolkit:** You can print out your matrix, use a whiteboard, or track it digitally. No matter the format, the power lies in visibility and simplicity. You'll always know what to do next.

### Example Project Matrix:

| List 24 Properties | Hire an Assistant | Have a CRM | Work a Farm | Write 1 Contract/Month |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Start using RedX Consistently | Write job description | Input past clients | Determine size and area | Hold open houses to generate buyers |

## Daily Call Tracker: Why It Matters

The Daily Call Tracker helps you stay focused and motivated while revealing patterns in your performance. It's more than just tallying numbers—it's about gaining insight so you can make smarter adjustments.

### Here's how to interpret the data:

**Example 1:** You made 10 calls, had 1 conversation, and booked 0 appointments.
➤ That tells you the issue may be volume—there simply weren't enough calls made.

**Example 2:** You made 30 calls, had 20 conversations, and got 1 appointment.
➤ You're doing well getting people on the phone, but your appointment-setting skills may need improvement.

**Example 3:** You made 10 calls, had 4 conversations, and booked 3 appointments.
➤ Your conversion rate is excellent! Imagine the outcome if you had made 30 calls that day.

Tracking your daily numbers helps you shift from guesswork to strategy. Over time, these small insights lead to massive results.

## Weekly Planning Sheet: How to Use It Effectively

This form is designed specifically for POWER AGENT® coaching members—but any real estate professional can benefit from using it.

Each week, take a few minutes to plan your upcoming seven days. For each day of the week, jot down urgent items, appointments, or time-sensitive tasks that must be completed on those dates.

At the top of the sheet, list your **Top 3 Must Accomplish tasks**. These are your three "big rocks" for the week. No matter what else happens, if you complete these, you'll feel like your week was a success.

Use the **POWER AGENT® Tools** section to note any classroom resources, strategies, or handouts you'll be applying.

The **Number One Thing I Need to Let Go** section gives you space to release something that's weighing you down—like frustration, resentment, or stress. Letting go creates space for fresh energy.

Finally, in the **Acknowledge Myself** section, take a moment to celebrate a win from the past week. Recognizing your progress helps build confidence and forward momentum.

*Find the Weekly Planning Sheet in the Time and Money Management Tab in the POWER AGENT® Classroom!*

## Daily Accomplishment Focus Sheet

Have you ever worked a full day only to lie in bed at night wondering, "What did I actually accomplish?" You're not alone.

This form is designed to help you stay laser-focused throughout the day—and finish with a real sense of achievement. Like many busy professionals, you probably have a long list of tasks and ideas swirling around at any moment. That's where this sheet comes in.

Each morning, take a moment to clear your mind and ask:

**"Of all the things I could do today, what are the few that I absolutely must do?"**

Choose a handful of priorities that, if completed, would make your day feel successful. These are the tasks that move the needle in your business and your mindset.

**Use this sheet daily to:**

- Clarify your focus
- Prioritize effectively
- End each day with momentum and confidence

## Your 30-Day Commitment Challenge

This 30-day challenge is a powerful way to gain momentum, build consistency, and grow your business through meaningful conversations.

Each day, your commitment is simple: talk to at least one buyer and one seller about real estate. That's two conversations per day—adding up to 60 focused interactions by the end of the month.

**Why it works:**

- Conversations are the gateway to appointments and listings.
- Repetition builds confidence, sharpens your skills, and increases visibility.
- Momentum multiplies—one good conversation can lead to many opportunities.

This isn't just a tracker—it's a declaration that you're serious about reaching your Next Level®. Print it out, add your photo, sign your name, and take it one day at a time. Your future business starts with today's commitment.

## Stay Focused Tools

### The Activity Tracker

This weekly Activity Tracker is your roadmap to staying consistent, intentional, and productive in your real estate business.

Each row lists high-impact prospecting activities—like calling past clients, connecting in Facebook groups, hosting virtual events, or sending mailings. But here's the best part: these activities are customizable. You can swap out or rewrite each line to reflect the prospecting methods you enjoy and excel at. If door knocking, video marketing, or pop-by gifts are your thing, plug those in!

Each column represents a day of the week. As you complete an activity, check off the box. Your goal should be to complete **at least two to three activities per day**—enough to stay in motion, but not so much that you burn out.

**Use this tracker to:**

- Build prospecting into your daily rhythm
- Identify which days you're most productive
- Stay consistent and accountable without overwhelm

Print one each week, or laminate and reuse it. Keep it in plain sight to start each day with focus and intention.

*Find the Daily Activity Tracker in the Time and Money Management Tab in the POWER AGENT® Classroom!*

### The Dot Board™

The Dot Board is a visual goal-tracking system designed to motivate you and keep success front and center.

Each dot represents a specific result or activity—such as a listing taken, buyer agreement signed, contract written, or home closed. You assign meaning to the colors or shapes of each dot (e.g., red for listings, green for sales, blue for offers written).

As you move through your month, you color in the dots as you hit those milestones. Over time, this simple visual turns into a scoreboard for your success.

**Why it works:**

- It brings energy and fun to goal tracking.
- It makes your progress visual and tangible.
- It helps you catch slow weeks early and get back on track.
- It creates momentum and boosts confidence.

Place your Dot Board somewhere visible—your office wall, a whiteboard, or even your fridge. Watching your progress light up one dot at a time is powerful fuel for your daily motivation.

*Find the Color Dot Board in the Time and Money Management Tab in the POWER AGENT® Classroom!*

---

### Quarterly Integrity Sheet

The Quarterly Integrity Sheet is your built-in reset button—an opportunity every 90 days to reflect, recalibrate, and recommit to your goals.

At the end of each quarter, take a quiet moment to answer four key questions:

**What worked this quarter?** Reflect on the wins, the habits that paid off, and the actions that moved your business forward.

**What didn't work?** Be honest about what fell short. Awareness is the first step toward growth.

**What do I need to adjust?** Identify tweaks—big or small—that can better align your actions with your intentions.

**Am I on track to hit my annual goals?** Use this checkpoint to course correct if needed or build on the momentum you've already created.

This isn't about judgment—it's about staying in integrity with yourself. Use this form to think strategically, stay accountable, and move into each new quarter with purpose and clarity.

*Find the Quarterly Integrity Sheet in the Time and Money Management Tab in the POWER AGENT® Classroom!*

### Listing Inventory Chart™

This chart does two important things to help you manage your business and forecast future income.

**Track Your Active Listings**

Each time you take a new listing, add a mark in the appropriate month. If you list five properties in March, fill in five squares under March. If three of those go under contract in April, reduce your chart to reflect only two remaining.

**Why remove listings once they're under contract?**

Because while technically active, most buyers and agents stop showing properties that are already pending—just like a pair of shoes on layaway. It's not fully sold, but it's off the shelf.

**Forecast Future Cash Flow**

This chart also acts like a crystal ball. Listings that go under contract today likely close in 30 to 60 days, triggering commission income. But if you don't replenish your inventory during that time, you could face a drought.

Tracking your inventory helps you avoid income gaps by ensuring there's always another transaction in the pipeline.

**Bottom line:** The more listings you have in inventory, the more consistent and predictable your cash flow will be.
