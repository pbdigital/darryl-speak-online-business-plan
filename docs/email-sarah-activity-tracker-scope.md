Hi Sarah,

You mentioned wanting to get the Activity Tracker and Dot Board integrated "sooner rather than later" — I agree these would be great additions that give agents a reason to come back to the platform throughout the year.

I've put together a scoping document that breaks down exactly what's included:

**[Activity Tracker & Dot Board — Scope Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWg7V-pKH8nKJJ6F1mT3NvzRlcaTGhRqLC-axDIm46U/edit?tab=t.0)**

Here's the quick version:

---

**Option A: Core Package — $4,500 AUD**

- Activity Tracker (daily entry, totals, mobile-friendly)
- Dot Board (monthly transaction scoreboard)
- Integration with Section 3 targets ("You need X reach-outs, you've done Y")

---

**Option B: Full Package — $6,000 AUD**

Everything in Core, plus:
- Weekly trend chart with week-over-week comparison
- Email nudges (incomplete section reminders + progress alerts)
- Keap integration for email delivery

---

The doc has the full breakdown of what's included vs not included for each feature, plus a few questions I'll need answered before we kick off.

Take a look when you get a chance and let me know which direction appeals.

Regards,
Paul
