## Prompt 1: Journaling & Reflection App UX Patterns

**Research Topic:** How leading journaling and reflection apps help users overcome blank page syndrome

**Context:** We're building an annual business planning tool for real estate agents. Section 1 asks users to complete deep reflection prompts like "What are you most grateful for from the past year?" and "What were your biggest struggles?" Users report not knowing what to type—they face "blank page paralysis" when confronted with open-ended textareas.

**Please research:**

1. **How do successful journaling apps (Day One, Reflectly, Journey, Stoic, Five Minute Journal, Jour) help users start writing?**
   - What UI patterns do they use to reduce blank page anxiety?
   - Do they use guided prompts, sentence starters, examples, or something else?
   - How do they balance structure vs. freedom?

2. **What specific techniques do these apps use for prompting?**
   - Sentence starters ("Today I feel..." or "One thing I'm grateful for is...")
   - Multiple choice before free text
   - Mood selection or sliders before writing
   - Voice-to-text options
   - Time-boxed writing (e.g., "write for 2 minutes")

3. **How do they handle different question types?**
   - Gratitude prompts specifically
   - Goal-setting prompts
   - Reflection on past events
   - Emotional/vulnerable questions

4. **What do users say about these approaches?**
   - App store reviews mentioning ease of use
   - Common praise for guided features
   - Complaints about feeling too rigid or too open

5. **Any notable UX patterns worth adopting?**
   - Progressive disclosure
   - Gamification elements
   - Streaks and motivation
   - Visual vs. text-based reflection

**Focus on actionable UI/UX patterns we can apply to a web-based business planning tool for busy professionals who are not natural journalers.**

## Prompt 2: Coaching & Goal-Setting Tool UX

**Research Topic:** How coaching platforms and goal-setting tools structure reflection for action-oriented users

**Context:** We're building an annual business planning tool for real estate agents—action-oriented professionals, not writers or journalers. The tool includes a "New Year's Reflection & Intention-Setting" section with 40+ open-ended questions about gratitude, values, goals, obstacles, and accountability. Users get stuck because they don't know HOW to think about the questions.

**Please research:**

1. **How do professional coaching and goal-setting tools structure reflection?**
   - Tools like BestSelf Journal, Commit Action, CoachAccountable
   - Notion/productivity templates for annual reviews
   - Executive coaching frameworks (GROW model, Wheel of Life, etc.)
   - How do they break down big reflection into manageable pieces?

2. **What makes some tools feel "easy" while others feel "overwhelming"?**
   - Number of questions shown at once
   - Question phrasing and length
   - Use of examples vs. blank fields
   - Progressive complexity (easy → hard)

3. **How do these tools help users who aren't natural reflectors?**
   - Frameworks that give structure to thinking
   - Templates or fill-in-the-blank approaches
   - Rating scales before open-ended questions
   - "Pick from a list" before "write your own"

4. **What patterns work specifically for business/professional goal-setting?**
   - Connecting reflection to concrete outcomes
   - Making abstract questions feel relevant to work
   - Balancing personal and professional reflection

5. **How do they handle the volume problem (many questions)?**
   - Chunking and pacing
   - Optional vs. required questions
   - Save and continue patterns
   - Showing progress effectively

**Focus on patterns that would resonate with busy professionals who want results, not therapy sessions.**

## Prompt 3: Behavioral Psychology of Reflection & Blank Page Syndrome

**Research Topic:** Psychological principles behind why people freeze on open-ended questions and techniques to overcome it

**Context:** We have a business planning tool where users must answer deep reflection questions like "What moments brought you the most joy?" and "What are your core values?" Users report "not knowing what to type"—classic blank page paralysis. We want to understand the psychology behind this and evidence-based techniques to help.

**Please research:**

1. **Why do people freeze when faced with open-ended reflection questions?**
   - Cognitive load and decision paralysis
   - Fear of judgment (even self-judgment)
   - Perfectionism and "getting it right"
   - Lack of metacognitive skills (not knowing how to reflect)
   - Emotional avoidance

2. **What techniques from therapy and coaching help people articulate thoughts?**
   - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) journaling techniques
   - Motivational Interviewing question structures
   - Expressive writing research (Pennebaker's work)
   - Socratic questioning methods

3. **What does research say about scaffolding reflection?**
   - Sentence stems and their effectiveness
   - Constraint-based creativity (how limits help)
   - The role of examples (helpful or limiting?)
   - Time pressure vs. open-ended time

4. **How do people naturally process reflection vs. how we ask them to?**
   - Verbal vs. written reflection
   - Social vs. solo reflection
   - Concrete vs. abstract prompting
   - Past-focused vs. future-focused framing

5. **What are evidence-based "tricks" to get people writing?**
   - The "just write anything" technique
   - Starting with easy/concrete before hard/abstract
   - Using memory triggers and anchors
   - The power of specific vs. general questions

**Focus on practical, implementable techniques—not academic theory. We need patterns that can be translated into UI/UX design.**

## Prompt 4: Form UX for Complex/Emotional Inputs

**Research Topic:** Best practices for designing forms that require thought, not just data entry

**Context:** Most form UX advice focuses on efficiency—reducing friction to collect data quickly. But our form is different: it's an annual business plan where users must THINK deeply about their answers to questions like "Who do you need to become to achieve your goals?" This isn't data entry; it's guided self-discovery. Users get stuck because traditional form UX doesn't apply.

**Please research:**

1. **How do UX designers approach forms that require reflection or complex thought?**
   - Case studies of non-transactional forms
   - Onboarding flows that ask meaningful questions (e.g., therapy apps, financial planning tools)
   - Personality assessments and how they guide responses
   - Application forms that require essays (college, grants, etc.)

2. **What micro-copy and prompting patterns help users think?**
   - Helper text that coaches rather than instructs
   - "Why we ask this" explanations
   - Examples that inspire rather than constrain
   - Progressive prompting (follow-up questions)

3. **How should complex forms handle pacing and cognitive load?**
   - One question at a time vs. grouped questions
   - When to show progress vs. when to hide it
   - Rest points and section breaks
   - Estimated time indicators

4. **What visual design patterns support reflection?**
   - Generous white space
   - Typography that encourages slow reading
   - Color and mood in reflection interfaces
   - Minimalist vs. warm/inviting aesthetics

5. **How do top products handle the "what am I supposed to write" problem?**
   - Typeform's conversational approach
   - Therapy apps like Woebot, Wysa, or Talkspace intake
   - Coaching platforms
   - High-end onboarding experiences

**Focus on translating these patterns into a modern web app built with React/Next.js and Tailwind CSS.**

1. Copy each prompt into Gemini Deep Research (or similar tool)
2. Wait for comprehensive results (10-20 minutes per prompt)
3. Copy the full results back to Claude
4. Claude will synthesize findings and continue the brainstorming session

**Tip:** You can run multiple prompts in parallel in different Gemini tabs.
